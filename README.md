# Tesla_Job_Application_Bot
Applies to jobs on the Tesla job page using selenium


Selenium script that applies to jobs on the tesla job page given the particular industry. The script is quite rough, as is evidenced by the liberal use of time.sleep()
methods instead of Implicit and Explicit waits, although effort was made to use them. Hope to replace that some day, and improve the quality of the script.
